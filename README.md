# Professional Operating Manual
Operating manuals are short documents that aim to help people learn to adapt to one another by offering an explicit description of oneâ€™s values and how one works best with others. This shortens the learning curve for new colleagues, and helps everyone avoid misunderstandings.

## My values
* Openness and honesty - I believe that it benefits no one to hold all your cards close to your chest, life is not a zero-sum game and by being open we not only grow ourselves, but we are able to build rapport with others. I always aim to be as open and honest as possible, but also understand that there are certain situations where less is more.
* Trust is granted, not earned - I aim to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and believe that everyone is trying their best and has the best intentions. 
* Be the change you want to see - We should all be empowered to bring change into the world. Nothig is too big or too small to tackle. Growth should be the one constant.
* Feedback is a gift - tbd

## My working style
* Work hard, go home - I want to be able to
* 

## My communication style
* In person, I can be direct and intense but I try to be light hearted! When I get intense, it usually means that I care deeply about the subject. I'm not very good at translating corporate speak and reading between the lines, so responding back with directness is often the best way for me to understand your intentions.
* Online meetings, my calendar is always open and up-to-date, if there's an empty slot feel free to book it, just make sure you include an agenda so I can come prepared.
* DMs, please DM me anytime! I mean it! The onous is on me to have proper notifications setup so that I am not disturbed. However, be aware that I will respond to you when I am ready.

## My leadership style
* 1:1s, this is *your* time. You're welcome to move it, update it, or delete it.

## Common misunderstandings
* I can sometimes be terse in the way I communicate, which can be interpreted as impatient or disrespectful, but the vast majority of the time I'm just trying to give the answer in the shortest possible way, and that usually means I miss giving the context. If you catch me feel free to ask me to clarify and/or provide context.
